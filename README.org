* HeffOS
HeffOS, or at least this version of it, is a Nix flake containing a number of system setups and packages.
It's designed to be modular, making it easier to add or remove programs or to create new systems.

** Libraries
HeffOS uses a number of libraries to achieve various features:
- Nixpkgs
  - This one is mostly obvious, but there are actually *three* branches of Nixpkgs in HeffOS: latest stable, unstable, and my personal fork
- Home Manager
  - This one is also pretty widely used; I use it to configure programs on a per-user basis
- NixOS-WSL
  - This one facilitates using NixOS as a WSL distro
- Flake Parts
  - This one is for non-host derivations that can be used across architectures, such as packages or shells
- Catppuccin
  - This one themes a *ton* of programs

** Hosts
| Host   | Purpose                                      |
|--------+----------------------------------------------|
| Hitori | The NixOS partition on my tower              |
| Ikuyo  | My Raspberry Pi 3B+                          |
| Futari | WSL2 on the Windows 11 partition on my tower |
| Ryo    | WSL2 on my laptop                            |

(Yes, the systems are, and will continue to be, named after characters from /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocchi_the_Rock%21][Bocchi the Rock!]]/)

** To-Do
- Set up new features on drive re-format
  - Automate BTRFS snapshots with BTRBK
  - Set up full-disk encryption?
- Add host "Hiroi" (via [[https://github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid][nix-on-droid]])
- Set up [[https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix][SOPS-Nix]]
- Use Nix' default host SSH keys
- Replace SDDM
- Set up Firefox with Arkenfox.js
